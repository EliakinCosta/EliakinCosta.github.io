Hi everyone, how is it going? Fine, I hope.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, I will talk about my work on Krita during the week 3-4 of the coding period.</p>

## Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">I implemented two new plugins, canvas size plugin and filter manager (applier) plugin. The first is a plugin to change image size (not scale) and to adjust the top and left edge to selected documents also. The second is a filter applier to the document or nodes, then you can select a node or the document and apply a filter to them.</p>

### Canvas Size Plugin

<b>GUI Mockup</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I drew a simple mockup to define some direction for my implementation. As you can see, it's something close to the current implementation, but without a canvas preview, we have a list of the opened documents, though.</p>

<b>C++ and SIP implementation</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to provide offset properties (xOffset, yOffset) to document API and a updating to the resizeImage method to include the new parameters. I implemented these properties and your respective SIP signatures. I also wrote documentation to each method implemented in .h files. Click <a href="https://cgit.kde.org/krita.git/commit/?h=eliakincosta/T5885-kritas-scripting-showcase&id=9f803a7da504134df300505bf0ebd99a5a94d6eb">here</a> to take a look.</p>

<b>GUI implementation with PyQt</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end, I implemented the GUI and all your interactions and validations. How you can see below, we have a confirm button that resizes the image to selected documents.</p>

<b>Testing</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Below, you can see the plugin working.</p>

### Filter Manager Plugin

<b>GUI Mockup</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I didn't draw a GUI mockup, but the main idea here is to have a tree showing documents and your nodes and a list of the application's filters.</p>

<b>C++ and SIP implementation</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I don't changed the C++ code, I fixed some bugs in the API, though.</p>

<b>GUI implementation with PyQt</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You can see below the final result of my work. The tree was implemented using <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/model-view-programming.html">Model-View pattern</a>. You can apply filters from the list to specific node or to all document (all top level nodes).</p>

<b>Testing</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Below, you can see the image before and after the application of the "desaturate" filter.</p>

### What will I do in the next week?

- Simple scripts of the previous plugins
- Plugin to take a list of images (inputted list) and apply rotate/scale
- Script to export all the layers (batch)
- Script to Duplicate image
- Script to Export to jpg X% quality.

That's it for now, until the next week. See ya!!
