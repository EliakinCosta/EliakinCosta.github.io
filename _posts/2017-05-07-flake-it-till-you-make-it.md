Hi Everyone, is everything ok? I hope yes ^-^

I'm here for the first time to talk about my first participation in a sprint/community event and try to comming out of my shell. To clarify this, I have to back in time...

I've aways been an introspective person and when I was approved to Analisys and Systems Development Course, I thought that I don't would need to talk with people anymore (while working at least) and I was happy with this xD. Things was going well until the day that I knew the Open Source Concepts and KDE, through my teacher, Sandro Andrade (yes, it's your fault :p). It was love at first sight, I liked the idea to share knowledge and help another people or I was just thinking that I could work with my shorts, I hate pants. I will never know the truth xD.

Sandro told me sometimes that's KDE is not about software is about people, I didn't get it your message that day. In the last year, I was approved to Season of KDE and the main problem to me besides code, was integrate me to community. My mentor Boudewijn, help me a lot on this point and today he is an inspiration to me. Thanks Boud.

Now you undesrtand what is my shell, but we will jump this disclaimer and go to first day in the LaKademy...

My first day in the LaKademy starded with each one presenting yourself, something like an "about me" session. It was amazing because there was so many different persons, that contribute of different ways, from different points of the Brazil. After this initial moment, we start to work in our KDE projects, in my case I continue my work in the Krita. 

My work in the first day was basically:


* I talked with Boud about implement some tests to Python Scripting API and he approved my suggestion.
* I chat with Dmitry Karzakov to undesrtand the current tests structure in the Krita.
* I wrote a basic structure with a simple unitest.TestCase subclass in python.
* I studied how to integrate python unit tests with cmake test.
* My initial tentatives don't had success, so I needed some help.
* I chat with Dmitry again and he gives me a good idea to integrate this test, but work to the next day.

This first day was
