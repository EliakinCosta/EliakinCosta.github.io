Hi everyone, how is it going? Fine, I hope.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, I will talk about my work on Krita during this second week of the coding period.</p>

### Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Color Space plugin represents a functionality that exists inside Krita. You can change the color space to a document how is showed below.</p>

The main difference between the plugin and the current implementation is that we can take a list of the currently opened documents. That shows how is easy replace old features with the Scripting API.

### Implementation

<b>GUI Mockup</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The first part of my work was figuring out how to implement a similar interface, but with the list of currently opened documents in the Krita. I drew a simple mockup to define some direction for my implementation.</p>

<b>C++ and SIP implementation</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I did know that the Krita classes inside libkis don't have a colorModels and colorDepths methods to show these properties in the GUI. I implemented these two methods and your respective SIP signatures. I also wrote documentation to each method implemented in .h files.</p>

<b>GUI implementation with PyQt</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end, I implemented the GUI and all your interactions and validations. How you can see below, we have a confirm button that set all color spaces to the selected documents.</p>

<b>Testing</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Below, you can see a rendered image before and after the application of the Gray color space.</p>

### What will I do in the next week?

- Plugin to Change canvas size for multiple documents
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Plugin to Take a predefined filter or one applied on one document and to apply in all comic pages for example or another documents(inputted list).</p>
- Upload to Task thread of simple scripts for all the previous plugins

That's it for now, until the next week. See ya!!
